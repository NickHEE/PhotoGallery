Given I am at the gallery screen of the PhotoGallery app
When I press the filter button
Then I see the search screen of the PhotoGallery app
And I see a field labeled latitude
And I see a field labeled longitude
And I see a field labeled distance
When I enter xxx.x as latitude
And I enter yyy.y as longitude
And I enter zzz.z as distance
And I press the button labeled "Search"
Then I see the gallery screen of the PhotoGallery app
And I see the pictures taken within zzz.z distance of xxx.x , yyy.y

Assume that the gallery is populated with test pictures from various locations.
We choose a location and distance to filter for that will return a single photo.
Check that the correct photo is displayed after filtering
	currentPhoto.getLocation()
	Check that location is within test distance.
